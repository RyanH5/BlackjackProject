## BLACKJACK

#### SKILL DISTILLERY WEEK 4 HOMEWORK

### Tools Used
- Java
- Git
- Github
- Eclipse 

### Learning Goals
- Better understanding of OOP / OOD
- Use enums, interfaces, and inheritance

### How to run program:
FIRST:
Game prompts user asking if they would like to play BlackJack
Any response creates a new Black Jack game, this is done so that I can offer multiple games down the line
CardGames class that I will add other games so the prompt will later be 
1. black jack
2. snake
3. tic tac toe
4. connect 4 (or whatever games I choose to implement)

This was an OOD decision so that I can scale to include more games in the future

SECOND: 
Input your name

THIRD:
Cards are dealt
If player or dealer has 21, game is over

FOURTH:
Standard Black Jack rules, player hits until bust or stay, dealer hits up to 17
Whoever has more points but less than 21 wins
